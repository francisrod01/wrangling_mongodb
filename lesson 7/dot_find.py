"""
Your task is to write a query that will return all cars with width dimension
greater than 2.5. Please modify only the 'dot_query' function, as only that
will be taken into account.

Your code will be run against a MongoDB instance that we have provided.
If you want to run this code locally on your machine, you will need to install
MongoDB, download and insert the dataset. For instructions related to MongoDB
setup and datasets, please see the Course Materials.
