"""
Your task is to be write a query that will return all cars manufactured by
"Ford Motor Company" that are assembled in Germany, United Kingdom, or Japan.
Please modify only 'in_query' function, as only that will be taken into account.

Your code will be run against a MongoDB instance that we have provided.
If you want to run this code locally on your machine,
you have to install MongoDB, download and insert the dataset.
For instructions related to MongoDB setup and datasets please see Course Materials.
